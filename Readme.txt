We are going to create a lottery decentralised application. 
We are going to create the frontend using React.js, smart contract using Solidity, 
and connect the frontend and the smart contract using web3.js library.

We are going to deploy the smart contract over the Goerli testnet. To make a communication
with the Goerli testnet, we are going to use Alchemy. Alchemy will act as bridge between our 
smart contract and the Goerli testnet so that we can talk to the Goerli testnet. 
(There are other uses of Alchemy as well)
